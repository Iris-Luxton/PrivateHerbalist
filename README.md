# PrivateHerbalist
Intro: 
Before cloud engineer career, I used to be a product development technologist, work primarily in supplement, food, pharma industries.
I have decided to create a chatbot that represent my knowledge over the past 5+ years. 
Hope you find this helpful. 

Project goal:
Create a chatbot to provide herbal advices based on knowledge of your provided condition. 
Please treat all advices as consulting resources and you must visit your doctor for any critical conditions.
